- Handle multiple access links per bot link if returned

## 3. Ensure Multiple Photos Forwarding ✅
- Verified that event.forward_to() preserves multiple media in the message natively
- Telegram handles multiple photos/media forwarding automatically
- No code changes needed

## 4. Preserve Blockquote and Format in Link Replacement ✅

- The replace() method preserves blockquote and other markdown formatting
