# TODO: Implement MongoDB Support, Duplicate Checking, Multi-threading, and Video Improvements

## 1. Update Dependencies
- [x] Add pymongo and aiofiles to requirements.txt

## 2. Configure MongoDB
- [x] Add MongoDB URI and database name to config.py
- [x] Add MongoDB connection setup in config.py

## 3. Integrate MongoDB in UserBot
- [x] Import pymongo in userbot.py
- [x] Initialize MongoDB client in UserBot.__init__
- [x] Create collection for processed links
- [x] Replace in-memory sets with MongoDB queries for processed_links and processing_links
- [x] Update process_bot_link to check and update MongoDB

## 4. Implement Duplicate Checking
- [x] Add DB query in process_bot_link to check if link is already processed before starting

## 5. Add Concurrent Processing
- [x] Modify bot_handlers.py to use asyncio.gather for processing multiple links concurrently

## 6. Improve Video Processing Speed
- [x] Add aiofiles import in video_processor.py
- [x] Use aiofiles for async file operations in download_and_reupload_video
- [x] Optimize send_file for efficient uploads

## 7. Fix Video Timestamp Display
- [x] Ensure all video attributes are extracted and logged in video_processor.py
- [x] Handle None values for attributes gracefully
- [x] Verify attributes are passed correctly during upload

## 8. Followup Steps
- [x] Install new dependencies: pip install pymongo aiofiles
- [x] Set up MongoDB (local or cloud) and update environment variables
- [ ] Test concurrent processing with multiple links
- [ ] Verify video uploads show correct timestamps
- [x] Run the bot and monitor logs for errors (syntax errors fixed)
